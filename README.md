# MLPR Prep Assignment - Distance-Based Classification

## Overview
This project is a part of the **Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (MLPR) Prep Assignment**, focusing on distance-based classification techniques. The goal is to implement and analyze classifiers that rely on distance metrics to categorize data points into different classes.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement distance-based classification algorithms.
- Explore various distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Mahalanobis distance.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Apply classification to a real-world dataset and visualize results.

## Features
- Implementation of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification.
- Exploration of different distance metrics.
- Data preprocessing and normalization.
- Performance evaluation using confusion matrices and statistical metrics.
- Visualization of classification boundaries.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd mlpr_distance_classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook distance_based_classification.ipynb
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Modify the dataset path in the script if needed.
- Experiment with different distance metrics.
- Adjust hyperparameters like `k` in KNN for better performance.
- Run the script and analyze classification results.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
